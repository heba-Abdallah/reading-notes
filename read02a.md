Markdown is away to style on the web such as the display of the document, formatting words, adding images and creating lists.

The Markdown has syntax that we can use on GitHub.com such as :

Headers : that we can use # for it

Emphasis: we use * or - one time to be italic and  * or - two times to be bold, even we can mix them in one sentence

List: we can order the codes by sorting them by numbers and unorder them by adding * before them

Images: by putting [the image] then (the source of it)

Links: [the name of the web] (the link of that web)

blockquotes: by adding >

we can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with {-} for the first row and separating each column with {|}

Task list: use [ ] the list items, to marks a task as complete use [x]
