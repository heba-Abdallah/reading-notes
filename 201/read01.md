When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server, then the unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested. The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.
Structuring Word Documents
The use of headings and subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of information, for example, a document might start with a large heading, followed by an introduction or the most important information.
You can see the HTML code for this page below:
 

The code from the last page. There are several different elements. Each element has an opening tag (<) and a closing tag (/>).
Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
Attributes tell us more about element, which provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.
 


The attribute name indicates what kind of extra information you are supplying about the element's content. It should be written in lowercase, the value is the information or setting for the attribute. It should be placed in double quotes. Different attributes can have different values.

<body>
We created everything inside, this element is shown inside the main browser window.
<head>
This contains information about the page. You will usually find a <title> element inside the <head> element.
<title>
The contents of the <title> element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit.

DOC TYPES
Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.

Comment’s in HTML
<!-- -->
If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:

<!-- comment goes here -->

Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

For traditional HTML layouts web page authors used <div> elements to group together related elements on the page. Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page. HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them.

 

Every website should be designed for the target audience it can be helpful to ask some questions about the people you would expect to be interested in the subject of your site, and you need to consider why they are coming. Your content and design should be influenced by the goals of your users. To help determine why people are coming to your website, there are two basic categories of questions you can ask:
1: The first attempts to discover the underlying motivations for why visitors come to the site.
2: The second examines the specific goals of the visitors. These are the triggers making them come to the site now. 
Knowing what your visitors are trying to achieve in your website you want to create a list of reasons why people would be coming to your site.
You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively. Look at each of the reasons why people will be visiting your site and determine what they need to achieve their goals. You can prioritize levels of information from key points down to non-essential or background information.


JavaScript is used to make websites more interactive, interesting and user-friendly, JavaScript uses jQuery because it makes writing it a lot easier. JavaScript allows you to makes web pages more interactive by accessing to select any element, attribute or text from an HTML pages, like: [select the text inside all of the element on a page] and modifying the content by adding element, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them, like: [Add a paragraph of text after the first element], we can specify set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe) which allow into access or change the content of the page, we have examples of JavaScript in the browser such as slideshows, forms, reload port of page, filtering data. So a script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal like the recipes, handbooks and manuals to write a script, you need to state your goal first and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve we need to define the goal, design the script and code each step. Rules for naming variables: 
1-	The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($) or an underscore (_) 
2-	The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign or n underscore.
3-	 You cannot use keywords or reserved words. 
4-	 All variables are case sensitive.
5-	 Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. 
6-	 If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.

•	Short Circuit Values
Logical operators are processed left to right, they short-circuit (stop) as soon as they have a result - but they return the value that stopped the processing.

•	Loops
Loops check a condition, if it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It will repeat until the condition returns false.
