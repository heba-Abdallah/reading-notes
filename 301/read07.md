
Who is Roy Fielding?

 He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.

Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

We have been doing that for a long time but none of the techniques and use today work well when you need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the entire world now some way of having one machine tell another machine about a resource that might be on yet another machine.

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

 What does a GET do?

 Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET

 What does a POST do?

 If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST

What does PUT do?

 If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT

 What does PATCH do?

 If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT.
