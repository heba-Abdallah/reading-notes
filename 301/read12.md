NoSQL vs sql
Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
SQL	NoSQL
primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS);	Primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
table based databases	document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores
have predefined schema	Have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
vertically scalable	horizontally scalable
uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data	Queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language).

What is a relational database?
Software system used to maintain relational databases is a relational database management system. To connect between the data that separated/distributes across different tables
What type of structure does a relational database work with?
One-to-One One-to-Many Many-to-Many
What is a ‘schema’?
It refers to the way of organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed. The fields where to have the data
What is a NoSQL database?
NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database. And it is a database that stores a lot of data in an efficient way
How does it work?
We have collections, and inside them we have documents where the data is assigned
What is inside of a Mongo database?
Collections and inside them we have documents
Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? And why.
MongoDB, because it does not have schema
What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
Having duplicate data
