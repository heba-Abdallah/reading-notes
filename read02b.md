Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various of files by recording changes.

Local Version Control (LVCS) control entails one data base on your hard disk that stores changes to files. Centralized Version Control (CVCS) streamlined the collaboration process ( by eliminating the need to involve all local databases), allowed the programmers to have more knowledge of team members activities. Distributed Version Control (DVCS) allows client to create mirrored repositories, these data backups can be easily placed on the server to replace any lost information.

Get is DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Get mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources, Git can tracks changes, in lost of data makes it difficult for snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.

Get can be installed in three ways:

1- Install as a package.

2- Install via another installer.

3- Download and compile the source code.

After Git has been installed we should perform some customization steps such as, configuration of variables by (git config), identity setting that we should set the user name and email address and confirm that you have the correct setting, then we have to configuration of a default text editor and check settings.
